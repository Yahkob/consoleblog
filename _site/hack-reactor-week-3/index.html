      <p>After a lot of procrastinating I finally got around to setting up my blog. For those of you that don’t know me my name’s Jake, I’m 24 living in San Fransisco from Flagstaff, Arizona. I moved to San Fransisco in late May to pursue my goal as of the last couple years to become a full stack software engineer. I’ve always been interested in tech related stuff and after going dead end job to dead end job waiting tables and working other odd jobs I decided it was time for a change. Vacationing in San Diego two Aprils ago I met a guy that asked me what I wanted to do with my life. I told him my plan was to go to school in hopes of getting a CS degree. He instantly shot me down and told me anything I would learn would be outdated and not prepare me for actual software development. He instead gave me a list of languages, libraries and frameworks to learn. I dove into JavaScript not really knowing what was going on…at all. I learned JavaScript, HTML and other random things. I have to say at this point I definitely did not think I could become a software engineer. At this point I was learning some other programming languages and solidifying my knowledge of JS at my own pace but it didn’t seem like enough. It was around this time I stumbled apon a article talking about “Programming Bootcamps” and the future of CS degrees. At first I read about Dev Bootcamp here in San Fransisco.. it sounded awesome so I started to learn a little bit of Ruby and made it my goal to get accepted into Dev Bootcamp. In the process of taking a handful of Ruby tutorials I started reading up on Quora about other programming bootcamps. I started to read about another bootcamp called Hack Reactor. Someone asked the question <a href="http://www.quora.com/Dev-Bootcamp/Im-interested-in-attending-a-Programming-Bootcamp-How-do-I-decide-between-Dev-Bootcamp-and-Hack-Reactor"> “How do I decide between Dev Bootcamp and Hack Reactor?”</a>. After reading one of the co-founders response I was instantly hooked, first of all Hack Reactor was 3 weeks longer than Dev Bootcamp and instead of putting in three hundred and some odd number of hours if you went to Hack Reactor you would be there for twice that time(thanks for selling me Shawn =D)! So I abandoned the plan of going to Dev Bootcamp and started to code until my eyes started to bleed. I quickly made it my life to learn how to code every minute of the day I could get away with it. The first interview I had I bombed….terribly. I then proceeded to code until my eyes bled again for a few weeks and scheduled another interview. This time I had a solid JS foundation and to my suprise passed. After passing I was given the task of building a small chat application with a little jQuery and AJAX. I had a lot of fun building it and was confident to pass the next interview. At this time I had just found out my girlfriend was pregnant so I fratically scheduled my next interview. So one cold December day I sat down and had a Skype interview with a HiR (Hacker in Residence) at Hack Reactor. Shaking and anxious after hearing the news I was going to be a father I started my interview. The guy interviewing me asked me a few questions about myself, I could barely answer those as it was from my level on anxiety. Next we got to the actual coding part of the interview. I flew through the first question and got to the second question I froze and had no idea what to do. Sadly he told me he didn’t think I was quite ready for Hack Reactor. He gave me the offer of finishing the next two problems in the next hour and he would give me the accept to go to Hack Reactor. I frantically tried to figure them out, I got the second one in a couple minutes since the pressure was off but the other problem really tested my patience and knowledge of JS. I emailed him the problems in hopes that I would just maybe get accepted. The next day I got a message from Hack Reactor telling me they weren’t going to accept me at the time. They told me if I wrote an application with Ruby on Rails or Meteor I could apply again. I tried poking around with Meteor and building what I thought was a pretty simple idea for a two player game. At this point I totally gave up. I realized this was part of being a software engineer, not always knowing what to do. Being a good software engineer is having the ability to overcome hurdles and have something completly foreign thrown at you and being able to figure it out. It took me about two months to write my <a href="http://bubblepopper.meteor.com">application</a> due to biting off a lot more than I could chew. When I was done I couldn’t believe I actually made something after going tutorial to tutorial. I scheduled my technical interview for March and studied JavaScript a ton. Long story short I took the interview and passed in about 15 minutes (the interviews are usually an hour long). When I said passing the pre technical interview was the best day of my life I lied when I passed the technical interview it was DEFINITELY the best day of my life. After that it was on the the pre course curriculum which was basically build a bunch of javascript helper methods and reorganize some data to look like twitter. This was extremly challenging but in the end was really rewarding and made me feel a lot more competent in the path I had chosen. I can’t begin to say how hard and emotional of an experience it was to get into Hack Reactor. You need to know JavaScript extremely well and then you need to learn it better. Looking back to last September when I started to prepare for all of this seems like a lifetime but I wouldn’t give it up for anything. The main point of this post was to let you know if you’re applying for a programming bootcamp and don’t get accepted at first never give up keep on trying, it’s very worth it. So here I am at my third week of Hack Reactor and even though it has been very sad to be away from my beautiful girlfriend and amazing newborn son it has been amazing. If you made it this far I commend you this is basically five blog posts I should have wrote but just compiled it into one huge one. I plan on blogging here as much as I can about my experience at Hack Reactor. If you have any questions or want any advice or interested in learning to code/getting into a bootcamp please reach out to me. I was in the same position as you reading Hack Reactorers(?) blogs before I got accepted.</p>
