<p>I'm currently attending school at Hack Reactor. We have 'sprints' which are two day projects to learn new tools or as I get further into the course work on projects. We had a couple of sprints for Backbone.js a lot of people just couldn't figure it out and ultimately ended up hating it. </p>

<p>Now once the backbone sprint was over there was a lot of talk about Angular.JS and how it very simple compared to backbone. While I agree I don't think backbone or angular are better or worse than each other there is a place for either in the right situation. Everyone at this point has been using some sort of Angular in there projects whether its a small MVP that uses Angular or a mobile app they can rapidly prototype using a tool like Ionic. I haven't really fallen for the hype and decided to revert to backbone. In the process of doing so I found out about Ember.js. I researched it a couple nights after school and after reading a few Quora questions and blog posts I decided I'd give it a shot. First off when I used Angular even though a lot of my peers had praised it for its simplicity I did not really find this the case. If you're used to a MVC (Model View Controller) Angular is quite different and is actually a Model View View Model. The one thing that confused me about Angular is you had to learn about $scopes, directives and just other weird Angular voodoo. </p>
<p>Angular is the oldest MVC(err MV VM), backbone comes second and Ember is the newest. Taking this into consideration Ember has received probably the most amount of steam for how new it is. Angular has just now started gaining popularity but Ember is continuously growing steam. Since I've started people have asked me why do you use Ember heres how I can answer that:
